# Our Database uses the FireBase API for development.
# We use JavaScript for our software development. 
# FireBase CLI and credentials, as well as a text editor to edit the code in are required to develop code and deploy our server. 
# We have a user login which takes a username and password. Once your account has logged in, you can view trips, which detail which train is used and station. Each # Train and Trip has its own ID.
